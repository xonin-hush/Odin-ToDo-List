## Features
- Ability to create Projects
- Ability to create Todos inside a project 
- Ability to Remove Todos
- All data will be stored in the local storage as a JSON file (you will not lose your data after refreshing)
## Things I got a better understanding of
- Dom manipulation
- Webpack bundler
- Handling local storage
- JSON format 
- Some OOP Principles
- Puttin { once: true } at the end of eventListeners so you don't keep adding eventListeners on top of each other (would cause unwanted behavior)
